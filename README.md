# jtgis

Static blog with:
- White background, Courier New font
- Pagination (6/page)
- Tags + Archives sidebar
- First image preview on homepage (from Markdown)
- GFM-style renderer: tables, task lists, strikethrough, autolinks, fenced code, blockquotes
- Works locally via inline posts data fallback, or hosted on GitHub Pages

Add images by placing them in `posts/` and referencing in your `.md` like `![Alt](myphoto.jpg)`.
