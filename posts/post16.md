# Fundy Footpath Trail Map

The Fundy Footpath is a wilderness hiking trail located along the Fundy coast of New Brunswick, Canada. It is a charter member of the UNESCO Fundy Biosphere Reserve and affiliated with the NB Trails Council Inc. and the Trans Canada Trail. The Footpath takes hikers through the coastal Acadian Forest, home to the world’s highest tides, old growth forests, and several rare and unique types of flora and fauna.

The hiking map was printed on heavy-duty waterproof paper, folded and inserted in the back of the new edition of the Fundy Footpath Hiker’s Guide Book. QGIS was the best and most functional choice for the creation of this map. Being free software the price was right for a volunteer creating a map for a non-profit organization. But the real advantage of QGIS was that it had all of the functionality and tools required to create a highly useful and detailed hiking map from start to finish. I would highly recommend QGIS to both experienced and beginning GIS users alike.
